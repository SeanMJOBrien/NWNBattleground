 A module for Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition (NWNEE)
 
 This module was created by others, but was abandoned and bequeathed to me to do with as I found useful.  After several years now I feel it has some interesting systems and scripts that would be of use to the community and should be released on GitHub so people can build it themselves (drop it all in temp0 and open your toolset to "recover" the module, build everything and you should be good to go).
 
 At any rate, stores are populated with random items with random names and qualities and abilities, which is very cool. They become stronger as teh game progresses, as their GP value limit is increased over time (rounds).
 
 Anyway, have fun, tons of cool little features, and the module itself is pretty fun.
